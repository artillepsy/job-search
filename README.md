# Job Search - Job Aggregator

Welcome to **Job Search**, a centralized platform designed to help job seekers discover opportunities across various industries in one streamlined interface.

## About the Project

This website is a **job posting aggregator**. Main mission is to simplify the job search process by collecting listings from multiple reputable sources and presenting them in a single, searchable database.

**Important Note:** This is primarily a **learning and portfolio project**. It is currently in active development as I explore web scraping, API integration, and database management.

## How It Works

1. **Aggregation:** We use public APIs and respectful web crawling to identify new job openings.
2. **Direct Links:** We do not host the application process. Every job listing includes a **direct link back to the original source**, ensuring that users apply through the official and most secure channels.
3. **Transparency:** We clearly attribute all data to its original source (e.g., Adzuna, CareersInPoland) to respect the intellectual property of the job boards and employers.

## Fair Use & Legal Compliance

We aim to be a "good citizen" of the web:

- **Backlinks:** Every job posting redirects traffic to the original poster's website.
- **Robots.txt:** We strictly follow `robots.txt` instructions and crawl at a low frequency to avoid server strain.
- **Public Data:** We only aggregate publicly accessible information.
- **Removal Requests:** If you are a site owner and wish to have your listings removed from our aggregator, please contact us at artillepsy@gmail.com and we will process the request immediately.

## Tech Stack (In Progress)

- **Frontend:** Angular
- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **API Integrations:** USAJobs, Adzuna, Remotive, etc.
