In order to create/update tables, there are a few commands that should be executed in order:

[x] delete Migrations folder in JobSearch.Data project
[x] dotnet ef database drop --force [in DataScraper project]
[x] dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p JobSearch.Data -s JobSearch.DataScraper
[x] dotnet ef database update -p JobSearch.Data -s JobSearch.DataScraper

To run scrapers locally:

[x] dotnet user-secrets set --project JobSearch.DataScraper "USAJobs:ApiKey" "your-actual-api-key"
[x] dotnet user-secrets set --project JobSearch.DataScraper "Scrapers:Email" "your-email@example.com"

To set a scraper to run locally:

[x] Go to JobSearch.DataScraper/Properties/launchSettings.json
[x] Set "commandLineArgs": "--scraper <current-scraper>",

If there's a problem with Azure hosted DB connection, try to add the IP of the current network to the firewall rules.

When deploying DB migrations to Azure, make sure that everything works correctly (check scraper jobs)
